# ECG-Classification
ECG classification with trained neural networks: GoogleNet,AlexNet,SqueezeNet. 
In general people can be divided in three groups:

• persons with cardiac arrhythmia (ARR)

• persons with congestive heart failure (CHF), and

• persons with normal sinus rhythms (NSR).

The goal of this project is to classify human electrocardiogram (ECG) signals using the Short Time Fourier
Transformation and the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
The resulting CNNs are used to classify the given ECG signal to ARR, CHF, and NSR, respectively.

# Steps to follow
Before starting run start_up.m file or just type start_up in the command window.

TestData file is made to test any ECG signal. But to test, you need to train the neural networks first. It is all available in TestData.mlx file
